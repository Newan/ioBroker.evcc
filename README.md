## evcc adapter for ioBroker

[evcc](https://evcc.io) controls the charging of your electric car with solar power. This adapter connects ioBroker
with your evcc: it shows all values of evcc in ioBroker (power, charging state, prices, vehicles …) and lets you
control charging from scripts, Blockly or your visualization – e.g. start or stop charging, set a charging target or a
charging plan.

Forum: https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/49165/neuer-adapter-iobroker-evcc

## Requirements

- a running evcc installation that ioBroker can reach over the network (web interface, default port 7070)
- evcc 0.316 or newer is recommended, older versions keep working

## Getting started

1. Install the adapter and open the instance settings.
2. Enter the IP address or host name of evcc (without `http://`) and the port.
3. Click **Test connection** – the adapter shows the evcc version and your loadpoints and vehicles.
4. Save. After a few seconds the values appear in the objects under `evcc.0`.

## Configuration

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Host or IP address | address of evcc, e.g. `192.168.1.10` or `evcc.local` |
| Port | port of the evcc web interface, usually `7070` |
| Poll interval | how often evcc is read. Shorter = more current values, but more load. Default 60 s |
| Test connection | checks the entered address without saving |
| Dissolve status objects | off: values that belong together (e.g. grid, pv, battery) are stored together in one data point. On: every value gets its own data point – handy for visualizations and charts, but creates more data points |
| Forecasts | stores the forecasts of evcc (solar, prices, CO₂, temperature). Only needed if you want to evaluate them in ioBroker, creates about 1,800 data points |

## Data points

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `info.connection` | `true` while evcc is reachable |
| `status` | values of the whole site, e.g. `pvPower`, `homePower`, `tariffGrid` |
| `control` | settings of the whole site, e.g. home battery (`bufferSoc`, `prioritySoc`) and price limits |
| `loadpoint.1`, `loadpoint.2` … | one entry per loadpoint (named like in evcc), with `status` (current values) and `control` (settings and buttons) |
| `vehicle.<name>` | one entry per vehicle (named like in evcc): minimum and target charge level, charging plan |

Everything below `control` can be changed – the adapter sends the new value to evcc.

## Controlling charging

| Data point | What it does |
|---|---|
| `loadpoint.X.control.off` / `.now` / `.smart` | buttons: stop charging, charge now at full power, charge with solar power |
| `loadpoint.X.control.pvControl` | the same as one value: `0` off, `1` smart, `2` smart + always charge, `3` now. Also shows the current mode |
| `loadpoint.X.control.alwaysCharge` | `on`: in smart mode always charge at least with minimum power, `once`: only until the vehicle is disconnected, `off` |
| `loadpoint.X.control.limitSoc` | charge up to this level (%) |
| `loadpoint.X.control.minCurrent` / `.maxCurrent` | minimum / maximum charging current (A) |
| `loadpoint.X.control.pv` / `.min` | old buttons, still work (smart without / with always charge) |

## Charging plan

With a charging plan the vehicle is charged up to a target until a given time, preferably with solar power or at low
prices. Set it per loadpoint under `loadpoint.X.control.plan`:

| Data point | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `plan.time` | when the target has to be reached. Empty or in the past: in 24 hours |
| `plan.soc` | target charge level in % (used when a vehicle is assigned to the loadpoint) |
| `plan.energy` | energy to charge in kWh (used when no vehicle is assigned, e.g. guest vehicle) |
| `plan.active` | `true` creates the plan, `false` deletes it. Shows whether a plan is set in evcc |

Set `time` and `soc`/`energy` first, then `active = true`. The same works per vehicle under `vehicle.<name>.plan`.

## Notes

- **evcc restarts (e.g. updates):** the adapter writes one warning, sets `info.connection` to `false` and reconnects
  automatically. When evcc is back, an info message appears in the log.
- **Values evcc does not report anymore** (e.g. the remaining charging time after charging) are set to empty (`null`).
- **Scripts from older versions:** since evcc 0.316 `loadpoint.X.status.mode` shows `smart` instead of `pv` / `minpv`.
  Use `loadpoint.X.control.pvControl` to tell the modes apart.
- `loadpoint.X.status.planActive` comes from evcc and means "charging according to plan right now", not "a plan is set".

## Changelog
<!--
    Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
    ### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->
### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
* (Schimi1983) evcc not reachable (e.g. restart/update): one warning instead of an error on every poll, info message when the connection is restored
* (Schimi1983) values evcc does not report anymore (e.g. `fatal`, remaining charging time) are set to `null` instead of keeping the last value
* (Schimi1983) existing status objects are updated to the current roles at start, also for values evcc currently does not report
* (Schimi1983) README: getting started, data points and charging control explained for users

### 0.3.2 (2026-11-06)
* (Schimi1983) state roles according to the ioBroker state roles: writable states use `level.*` / `switch` / `button.*` / `text` instead of `value`, min/max for percent values, JSON values use role `json` (type string), strings `text`, remaining durations `value.timer`; ids and values are unchanged
* (Schimi1983) complete object tree: folders `loadpoint` / `vehicle`, a device per loadpoint and vehicle (named by its evcc title), channels `control` / `status`
* (Schimi1983) price limits under `control` use the currency configured in evcc, buttons are confirmed with ack = true
* (Schimi1983) admin: reworked config page (connection / data points sections, help texts, validation, units), new "Test connection" button
* (Schimi1983) fix: host was cut when it contained "http" anywhere (e.g. a host name), now only a leading http:// / https:// and a path are removed
* (Schimi1983) defaults for new instances: poll interval 60 s, port as number
* (Schimi1983) repository checker (#141): unit tests use node:assert instead of chai (W0063), package.json "files" instead of .npmignore (W9503), i18n short format (S5601)
* (Schimi1983) remove unused workflow file dependabot-automerge.yml.OLD (pull_request_target, #139)
* (Schimi1983) fix: polls took longer than the interval with many states (e.g. weather forecast) – values are now written in batches
* (Schimi1983) fix: no errors in the log when the adapter is stopped during a poll
* (Schimi1983) fix unit tests: chai-as-promised is no longer loaded in test setup (not a direct dependency anymore)
* (Schimi1983) charging plan per loadpoint: `control.plan.active/time/soc/energy` (soc plan of the assigned vehicle or energy plan of the loadpoint), closes #73 and #18
* (Schimi1983) repository checker (#135): remove test dependencies already provided by @iobroker/testing, CHANGELOG_OLD.md in .npmignore, consistent formatting of admin/jsonConfig.json

### 0.3.1 (2026-10-10)
* (arteck) Dependencies have been updated
* (Schimi1983) fix: `enableThreshold` / `disableThreshold` could not be set
* (Schimi1983) fix: global `control.smartCostLimit` was sent to loadpoint `undefined`
* (Schimi1983) fix: `smartCostLimit` / `batteryGridChargeLimit` = 0 now removes the limit (DELETE), negative limits are allowed
* (Schimi1983) fix: `chargeDuration` / `connectedDuration` are reported by evcc in seconds (were treated as nanoseconds)
* (Schimi1983) fix: vehicle plan (`plan.active`, `plan.planSoc`, `plan.time`) is read from and written to evcc again
* (Schimi1983) remove unused calls to removed evcc endpoints
* (Schimi1983) fix: control actions were called with the adapter as `this` instead of the evcc client
* (Schimi1983) performance: objects are created once per runtime instead of being rewritten on every poll, polls no longer overlap
* (Schimi1983) add units and roles (W, Wh, kWh, A, %, km, s, €/kWh, g/kWh, °C) for known evcc status values, indicator role for booleans

### 0.3.0 (2026-10-02)
* (Schimi1983) support evcc 0.316 mode redesign: new `control.smart` and `control.alwaysCharge`, `pvControl` reflects the evcc mode
* (Schimi1983) fix: request timeout was sent as POST body and never applied
* (arteck) Dependencies have been updated
